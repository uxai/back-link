# Back links for static websites

When we want a back button to take users to the previous page in our interface, what is the expected behaviour and how do we solve for history outside of our domain scope?
I created this simple script to better handle back links for static websites.

For more details on what I'm solving for check my blog post.

Simply download the script, and link to the file from your source code, then change the global URL to your own. Make sure to include the / at the end of the URL like so:

`URL = https://uxai.net/`
